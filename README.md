# ðŸ“¦ Chat and Embedding Models using LangChain

This repository demonstrates how to build and interact with **LLM-based chat interfaces** and generate **text embeddings** using the **LangChain framework**. It covers both **Hugging Face-hosted models** (via API) and **locally run models**, making it a hands-on guide for integrating language models in real-world NLP pipelines.
